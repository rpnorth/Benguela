# Meso- to submesoscale transition observed across and along a filament in the Benguela upwelling system
Data analysis of high-resolution in-situ data and remote sensing images (altimetry and infrared) to reveal a detailed characterisation of properties along and across a filament observed in the Benguela upwelling region together with its evolution and lifetime. To be published as part of a peer-reviewed scientific paper.

__Notebooks of note__:

[020a.Maps_Spatial_Ro_Paper_Story_Thread.ipynb](deliver/020a.Maps_Spatial_Ro_Paper_Story_Thread.ipynb): Data Analysis combining satellite images (infrared and altimetry), drifter tracks and ship-based in-situ measurements to understand how offshore currents (filaments) and eddies develop. Includes the application of Gaussian Process Regression, a supervised machine learning method, to fill in spatial data gaps.

[020b.Transects_Spatial_Ro_Paper_Story_Thread.ipynb](deliver/020b.Transects_Spatial_Ro_Paper_Story_Thread.ipynb): Data Analysis of in-situ measurements taken across a filament â€” currents that carry cold-water offshore. Analysis includes features of engineering to better understand the physical properties driving the evolution of the filament.
